# Static-Timing-Analysis-in-Brief

The basic STA algorithm can support upto 10 million instances. STA over-estimate the delay of long paths. If there is any short path SAT will ignore them . This will make analysis "fast" and will not suffer from hold-time violations. 



### Timing Analysis are of two types --->  1.Dynamic 2.Static

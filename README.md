# Static-Timing-Analysis-in-Brief

The basic STA algorithm can support upto 10 million instances. STA over-estimate the delay of long paths. If there is any short path SAT will ignore them . This will make analysis "fast" and will not suffer from hold-time violations. 



### Timing Analysis are of two types --->  1.Dynamic 2.Static

1. Dynamic : Time is involved during analysis . We actively include time by hand in Dynamic analysis. At input we need to run sweep so timing will be there. 
 
     a. Its will used to analysis IPs and BLOCKs    

2. Static : No time involved in input files or output files.
 
    a. its will done on larger circuts like ASIC/SOC/FPGA.
